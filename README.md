# Tracklist viewer

This is a client side only app created to allow the singer of my band to make a tracklist and browse through it with ease. 

Once a song is opened it is possible to increase and decrease the fontsize, the lyrics will automatically position on different columns based on the available space. 

### next steps
Add the opportunity to save the tracklist order and the fontsizes in the local storage 
maybe add a server to be able to add and remove songs dynamically. Currently all the songs are stored in a js file called songData.
