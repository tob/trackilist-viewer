When the bright lights have faded to blue \\n
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have \\n
Loved me and I never knew \\n
You know I've always been a dreamer \\n
(Spent my life running 'round) \\n
And it's so hard to change \\n
(Can't seem to settle down) \\n
But the dreams I've seen lately \\n
Keep on turning out and burning out \\n
And turning out the same \\n
\\n
So put me on a highway \\n
And show me a sign \\n
And take it to the limit one more time \\n
\\n
You can spend all your time making money \\n
You can spend all your love making time \\n
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow \\n
Would you still be mine? \\n
\\n
And when you're looking for your freedom \\n
(Nobody seems to care) \\n
And you can't find the door \\n
(Can't find it anywhere) \\n
When there's nothing to believe in \\n
Still you're coming back, you're running back \\n
You're coming back for more \\n
\\n
So put me on a highway \\n
And show me a sign \\n
And take it to the limit one more time \\n
\\n
Take it to the limit \\n
Take it to the limit \\n
Take it to the limit one more time \\n

Blue lights in my rearview \\n
New life, career too \\n

I still get flashbacks \\n
Man done bare moves \\n
Ran up in houses \\n
Filled vans and cleared rooms \\n
Before I had an accountant \\n
I weighed grams in Claire's room \\n
And all she wanted out of it \\n
Was money for a hairdo \\n
Maybe an outfit \\n
I was like fair doos \\n
Cah that was my down chick \\n
From 'round about year 2 \\n
Just jumped in the whip \\n
Driver said, "Where to?" \\n
I told him Balham \\n
Cats know I'll be there soon \\n
Trap house smokey \\n
I know about bare fumes \\n
Ran from the police \\n
Window and I hear boom \\n

Distant memory \\n
Chase through Blackwall Tunnel \\n
Went for a different entry \\n

Mine's consistent, not temporary \\n
If they're talking trouble \\n
It was based on instant envy \\n
If they're talking bubbles \\n
Back when they was called 120's \\n
Look, how long I been styling? \\n
How long I been riding? \\n
How long I been driving? \\n
How long was I hiding? \\n
Warrant out for my arrest \\n
Feds pouring out of my address \\n
Persistent offender \\n
Different agenda \\n
I did not surrender \\n
Stereotyped by any system I enter \\n
TDK, nah, I mean TDA, nah, I mean GBH \\n
Free Titch, free Ashman, free Tyler, I feel his pain \\n
